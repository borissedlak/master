## Next Steps
- Transform audio as well? How to detect something here? Interesting for later!
- 
### Monitoring
- show processing time in the sfu
  - include that in a rtt### Coffe
- <span style="color:red">how to build models? Could I do it myself? It would be cool but would take some time, but it would be an awesome example
- <span style="color:red">is there maybe another model publicly available?
- <span style="color:red">how to add new models asynchronously? --> Same as lambda technically

### Lambdas
  - <span style="color:red">how to actually call lambda functions? 
    - Maybe indiced array of functions?

### Not important anymore?
    
- Ensure that videos from a producer are replayed in correct fps.... well stick to camera then because live streams are the most interesting part
  - however, for evaluation it could be interesting
- change webcam output format? Why could this be necessary?
  - for testing the maximum framerate my system can handle!
    - but I could also enqueue every frame twice/thrice/... and see if it can cope with this

### Only for thesis?
- <span style="color:orange">present formula for max time that a sfu can take to ensure stream in same fps. Interesting for later!</span>
