## Next Steps
- add controller to client
- Ensure that videos from a producer are replayed in correct fps....
- Transform audio as well? How to detect something here?
- change webcam output format? Why could this be necessary?
### Monitoring
  - show fps of consumed video
  - show processing time in the sfu
    - include that in a rtt
    - <span style="color:orange">present formula for max time that a sfu can take to ensure stream in same fps</span>
### Coffe
  - <span style="color:red">how to build models? Could I do it myself? It would be cool but would take some time, but it would be an awesome example
  - <span style="color:red">is there maybe another model publicly available?
  - <span style="color:red">how to add new models asynchronously? --> Same as lambda technically
### Lambdas
  - <span style="color:red">how to actually call lambda functions? 
    - Maybe indiced array of functions?
